# EPUB to XTC Converter for Xteink X4
**Comprehensive EPUB to XTC/XTH conversion with AI-Powered Reading Aids**

A powerful GUI-based tool designed to convert standard `.epub` files into the binary `.xtc` (1-bit) or `.xth` (2-bit) formats required by the **Xteink X4** e-reader. This tool renders HTML content into paginated, bitmapped images optimized specifically for E-Ink displays, ensuring a premium reading experience.

*(Note: Web version is currently a legacy release and does not yet support 2-bit rendering or Spectra AI)*

## 🚀 Main Features

* **Visual & Native Navigation:** Automatically renders a formatted **Visual Table of Contents** into the book's first pages. Simultaneously injects Title, Author, and Chapter metadata into the binary header, enabling the device's native menus and physical chapter-skip buttons.
* **Spectra AI Reading Aide (Experimental):** An AI-powered overlay that scans text for difficult vocabulary and prints context-aware definitions or translations directly above the words.
* **Smart Vocabulary Filtering:** Uses Zipf frequency and Age of Acquisition (AoA) databases to target only the words that match your specific reading level (A2–C1). 
* **Advanced Rendering Engine:** * **1-Bit (XTG) & 2-Bit (XTH):** Support for 4-level grayscale rendering for smoother anti-aliasing and better illustration depth.
* **Modern Interface:** A sleek, dark-themed UI with collapsible settings cards for Typography, Layout, and Rendering.
* **Deep Typography Control:** Full support for custom `.ttf`/`.otf` fonts with adjustable weight, size, line height, and `pyphen`-based hyphenation.
* **Inline Footnotes:** Automatically renders internal references directly below the text block, eliminating the need for page-jumping.
* **Cover Optimization:** Built-in utility to resize, crop, and dither covers into high-quality e-ink bitmaps.
