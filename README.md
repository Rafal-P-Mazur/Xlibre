# EPUB to XTC Converter for Xteink X4
Epub to XTC converter

A GUI-based tool designed to convert standard `.epub` files into the `.xtc` binary format required by the **Xteink X4** e-reader. It renders HTML content into paginated, bitmapped images optimized for e-ink displays.

[![Web Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Web_Version-Live-green)](https://epub2xtc.streamlit.app/)

## Main Features

* **Smart Table of Contents:** Automatically generates visual TOC pages that dynamically adapt to your selected font size, line height, and margins.
* **Chapter Visibility Control:** Non-destructively hide specific chapters from the **Table of Contents** and **Progress Bar** while keeping the text readable in the book.
* **Dynamic Footer Engine:** Fully customizable bottom area. Toggle the **Progress Bar**, **Page Numbers**, or **Chapter Titles** independently. Supports adjusting text position (Above/Below bar), font size, and bar thickness.
* **Preset Management:** Save and load your favorite layout configurations via the `presets/` folder. Presets are JSON-based and cross-compatible with the Web version.
* **Custom Typography:** Drop external `.ttf` or `.otf` files into the `fonts/` directory to use them instantly. Includes sliders for font weight, size, and line height.
* **Smart Hyphenation:** Uses `pyphen` to inject soft hyphens into text nodes, ensuring proper line breaks and justified text flow.
* **Image Optimization:** Automatically extracts, scales, contrast-enhances, and dithers (Floyd-Steinberg) images embedded in the EPUB.
* **Layout Control:** Configurable margins, top/bottom padding, orientation (Portrait/Landscape), and text alignment (Justified/Left)
